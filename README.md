## Overview

### The challenge

This project will be a brilliant test of your HTML, CSS, and basic JavaScript skills. You'll use JS to toggle the visual state of the notifications.

Your users should be able to:

- Distinguish between "unread" and "read" notifications
- Select "Mark all as read" to toggle the visual state of the unread notifications and set the number of unread messages to zero
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The page is fully responsive and works well on different screen sizes.
- **Interactive Elements**: Users can mark all notifications as read, which updates the notification count and changes the styles accordingly.
- **Lazy Loading**: Images are lazy-loaded to improve performance.
- **Semantic HTML**: The HTML structure is semantic and accessible.

### What I Learned

- **CSS Variables**: I learned how to use CSS variables to maintain consistent styling across the project.
- **Flexbox**: I improved my understanding of Flexbox for creating flexible and responsive layouts.
- **JavaScript DOM Manipulation**: I enhanced my skills in manipulating the DOM using JavaScript to create interactive elements.
- **Responsive Design**: I learned how to use media queries to make the design responsive and ensure it looks good on different devices.

### Continued Development

- **Accessibility Improvements**: I plan to add more accessibility features, such as focus styles for interactive elements and ARIA roles.
- **Code Optimization**: I aim to further optimize the JavaScript code for better performance and readability.
- **Additional Features**: I would like to add more features, such as filtering notifications and adding animations for better user experience.
